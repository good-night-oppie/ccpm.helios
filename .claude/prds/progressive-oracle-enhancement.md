# PRD: Progressive Oracle Enhancement

## Executive Summary

Transform Done Oracle from a standalone completion verification service into an intelligent, progressive reasoning system that enhances Claude Code development workflows. Based on comprehensive Three-Lens Analysis, this enhancement implements selective Oracle complexity activation to provide authoritative completion decisions while maintaining execution discipline and user-centric design.

**Value Proposition**: Deliver AI-driven, cryptographically-verified completion decisions that improve development workflow quality without adding unnecessary complexity to routine operations.

## Problem Statement

### What problem are we solving?

**Current State**: Done Oracle operates as a standalone 4-gate evaluation service with limited integration into development workflows. Claude Code and ccpm.helios rely on manual completion detection and basic status reporting, leading to:

1. **Inconsistent Completion Quality**: Agents self-report completion without validation
2. **No Learning Feedback**: System doesn't improve completion detection over time
3. **Binary Status Model**: Simple open/closed states without nuanced quality assessment
4. **Human Dependency**: Requires manual judgment for complex completion decisions
5. **Missed Optimization**: No systematic identification of completion patterns

### Why is this important now?

**Market Research Evidence**: 84% of developers use AI tools but experience 19% productivity loss on complex tasks due to "almost correct" AI output requiring extensive debugging. The market strongly favors simple, reliable tools over complex orchestration systems.

**Competitive Landscape**: Current AI development tools lack sophisticated completion reasoning, creating opportunity for differentiation through intelligent Oracle-driven decisions.

**Strategic Timing**: AI evolution trend toward more sophisticated reasoning systems aligns with Oracle architecture investment, providing competitive advantage if implemented thoughtfully.

## User Stories

### Primary User Personas

#### Persona 1: Claude Code Developer
**Background**: Uses Claude Code daily for development tasks ranging from simple debugging to complex architecture analysis.
**Pain Points**: Uncertainty about when AI has truly "completed" a complex task vs needing more work.
**Goals**: Reliable completion decisions that improve over time, especially for sophisticated problems.

#### Persona 2: ccpm.helios Project Manager
**Background**: Manages multi-agent development projects with parallel task execution.
**Pain Points**: Difficulty coordinating agent completion across 4-6 parallel streams, manual orchestration overhead.
**Goals**: Authoritative completion decisions that enable autonomous agent coordination.

#### Persona 3: Development Team Lead
**Background**: Oversees AI-assisted development workflows for production systems.
**Pain Points**: Quality consistency across AI-generated solutions, debugging "almost correct" outputs.
**Goals**: Trustworthy completion verification with audit trails and learning improvements.

### Detailed User Journeys

#### Journey 1: Complex Debugging Session (High-Value Oracle Scenario)
```
1. Developer encounters multi-file bug affecting authentication system
2. Claude Code detects complex scenario (>3 files, cross-system impact)
3. System automatically activates Oracle reasoning mode
4. Oracle analyzes code changes, test results, integration impacts
5. Oracle provides structured reasoning trace and completion decision
6. Developer receives confident "done" verdict with evidence-based explanation
7. Oracle decision recorded for learning and future similar problems
```

#### Journey 2: Simple Code Fix (Fast-Path Scenario)
```

5. Epic orchestrator relies on Oracle for final project completion assessment
```

### Pain Points Being Addressed

1. **Completion Uncertainty**: Eliminate guesswork about when complex development tasks are truly complete
2. **Quality Inconsistency**: Provide systematic completion verification across all development scenarios
3. **Manual Coordination**: Enable autonomous agent orchestration through authoritative Oracle decisions
4. **No Learning**: Build completion intelligence that improves through experience and feedback
5. **Debugging Overhead**: Reduce time spent validating and debugging "almost correct" AI outputs
