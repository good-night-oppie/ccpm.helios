# PRD: PYI (P-Y-I) Sandbox-Specific State Management System

## Executive Summary

**PYI (P-Y-I)** is a revolutionary **full documentation workflow system** with Git-native integration and quantum-inspired sandbox-specific state management, designed to enable AI agents to execute long-horizon compute workloads (6+ hours) with sub-100μs checkpoint capabilities. Unlike traditional systems optimized for persistent data, PYI targets ephemeral AI experimentation workflows in compute-intensive domains including quantitative finance, scientific simulation, semiconductor design, and EDA verification.

**Quantum Physics Inspiration**: PYI embodies quantum superposition principles where potential multi-states coexist in parallel until they collapse into a single observation. Like quantum particles existing in multiple states simultaneously until measured, PYI allows multiple experimental agent states to exist in parallel until successful computations are observed and preserved, while failed experiments naturally collapse and are garbage collected. This quantum-inspired approach enables massive parallelism with intelligent state selection.

**Core Innovation**: First system to optimize for "ephemeral experimentation" rather than "persistent storage" - achieving 100-1000x performance improvements over academic state-of-the-art for agent-specific workloads.

**Go-to-Market Strategy**: Seamless Git workflow integration reduces adoption friction while maintaining specialized performance advantages for compute-heavy scenarios. Integration testing with CCPM (Claude Code Project Management) validates parallel architecture compatibility.

## Problem Statement

### What problem are we solving?

Current state management systems (Git, ZFS, Docker) are fundamentally misaligned with AI agent computation patterns:

1. **Long-Horizon Compute Failure**: Traditional systems can't maintain state across 6+ hour sessions required for:
   - Hedge fund quantitative backtesting and simulation
   - Foundational scientific computation experiments
   - Massive chipset logical gate design and verification
   - Complex EDA software workflows

2. **Ephemeral vs. Persistent Mismatch**: 90%+ of AI agent experiments are discarded, but current systems optimize for "keep everything forever" rather than "rapid create/destroy"

3. **Agent-Scale Performance Gap**: Academic checkpointing (CRIU: 10-100ms) is 100-1000x too slow for sub-100μs iteration cycles needed by parallel agent workflows

### Why is this important now?

- **AI Development Scale**: Teams are running 850+ parallel agents requiring independent state spaces
- **Compute Economics**: Hedge funds and scientific teams lose millions from interrupted long-running computations
- **EDA Complexity**: Modern chipset verification requires uninterrupted multi-hour simulation runs
- **Academic Gap**: No existing system addresses sandbox-specific optimization for AI workloads

## User Stories

### Primary User Personas

#### 1. **Quantitative Finance Engineer (Hedge Fund)**
