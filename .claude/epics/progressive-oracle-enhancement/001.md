# Task 001: Oracle Service Enhancement

## Summary

Enhance the existing Done Oracle service to provide stable, high-performance infrastructure for progressive reasoning capabilities. This involves optimizing the current Oracle backend for increased throughput, adding MCP protocol compatibility, and implementing comprehensive monitoring without changing any user-facing functionality.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Performance Requirements
- [ ] Oracle API response time: 95th percentile <30s for complex reasoning
- [ ] System availability: 99.9% uptime
- [ ] Support 1000+ concurrent sessions
- [ ] Memory usage optimization: <2GB base footprint

### API Stability
- [ ] RESTful API with OpenAPI 3.0 specification
- [ ] Versioned endpoints (/v1/, /v2/) for backward compatibility
- [ ] Graceful error handling with detailed error codes
- [ ] Request/response validation with schema enforcement

### Infrastructure Readiness
- [ ] Docker containerization with multi-stage builds
- [ ] Horizontal scaling support with load balancer compatibility
- [ ] Health check endpoints (/health, /ready, /metrics)
- [ ] Structured logging with correlation IDs

### Monitoring & Observability
- [ ] Prometheus metrics for request latency, throughput, error rates
- [ ] Jaeger distributed tracing for request flow analysis
- [ ] Application logs in JSON format with log levels
- [ ] Alert thresholds for SLA violations

## Technical Approach

### Performance Optimization
```typescript
interface OraclePerformance {
  responseCache: LRUCache<string, OracleDecision>
  connectionPool: DatabasePool
  requestQueue: PriorityQueue<OracleRequest>
  rateLimiter: RateLimiter
}
```

### API Enhancement
- Implement circuit breaker pattern for external dependencies
- Add request deduplication for identical reasoning requests
- Implement timeout handling with configurable limits
- Add compression support for large reasoning traces

### Infrastructure Improvements
- Database connection pooling and query optimization
- Memory-efficient reasoning trace storage
- Asynchronous processing pipeline for non-critical operations
- Graceful shutdown handling for zero-downtime deployments

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Oracle service passes load testing with 1000 concurrent users
- [ ] All API endpoints have <500ms response time for health checks
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards show comprehensive service metrics
- [ ] Docker image builds successfully and passes security scans
- [ ] Service restarts gracefully with zero data loss
- [ ] API documentation is complete and validated
- [ ] Integration tests cover all critical endpoints
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet or exceed requirements

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies
- Existing Done Oracle codebase and database schema
- Docker infrastructure and container registry
- Monitoring stack (Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger)
- Load balancer configuration and SSL certificates

### Team Dependencies
- Done Oracle team for backend architecture guidance
- DevOps team for infrastructure setup and deployment
- Security team for vulnerability assessment and compliance

## Estimated Effort

**Duration**: 4-6 weeks
**Complexity**: Medium-High
**Risk Level**: Medium

### Breakdown
- **Week 1-2**: Performance analysis and optimization
- **Week 3-4**: API stabilization and monitoring implementation
- **Week 5-6**: Infrastructure improvements and testing

## Success Metrics

- **Performance**: 95th percentile response time <30s maintained under load
- **Reliability**: Zero unplanned downtime during testing period
- **Scalability**: Linear performance scaling up to 1000 concurrent sessions
- **Observability**: 100% request correlation and distributed tracing coverage

## Risks & Mitigation

### High Impact Risks
- **Database performance bottlenecks**: Implement query optimization and connection pooling
- **Memory leaks in reasoning engine**: Add comprehensive memory profiling and limits
- **External API rate limiting**: Implement circuit breakers and retry mechanisms

### Medium Impact Risks
- **Container orchestration complexity**: Use proven Docker patterns and health checks
- **Monitoring data volume**: Implement sampling and retention policies
- **SSL certificate management**: Automate certificate rotation and validation

## Notes

This task establishes the foundation for all subsequent Oracle enhancements. Focus on stability and performance optimization without adding new features. The enhanced service must be production-ready to support Phase 2 selective activation.
