# Task 003: A/B Testing Framework

## Summary

Implement a comprehensive A/B testing framework to safely compare Oracle-enhanced vs. standard completion verification workflows. This framework enables controlled rollout, performance measurement, and user experience validation for Oracle features while maintaining system reliability and providing clear success metrics.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Framework Infrastructure
- [ ] User cohort management with configurable distribution (e.g., 10% Oracle, 90% standard)
- [ ] Feature flag system for instant Oracle enable/disable capability
- [ ] Session-based experiment assignment with consistent user experience
- [ ] Experiment configuration via admin interface with real-time updates

### Metrics Collection
- [ ] Response time comparison between Oracle and standard paths
- [ ] Completion accuracy measurement using developer feedback
- [ ] User satisfaction scoring through implicit behavioral metrics
- [ ] System resource utilization monitoring (CPU, memory, database load)

### Statistical Analysis
- [ ] Statistical significance testing with confidence intervals
- [ ] Sample size calculations for reliable A/B test results
- [ ] Automated reporting with experiment health dashboards
- [ ] Anomaly detection for unexpected behavior patterns

### Safety Controls
- [ ] Automatic rollback triggers for performance degradation
- [ ] Circuit breaker for Oracle service failures affecting A/B groups
- [ ] Data quality validation for accurate metric collection
- [ ] User consent and privacy compliance for experiment participation

## Technical Approach

### Experiment Management System
```typescript
interface ExperimentConfig {
  id: string
  name: string
  description: string
  startDate: Date
  endDate: Date
  trafficAllocation: {
    control: number    // Standard completion verification (%)
    treatment: number  // Oracle-enhanced completion (%)
  }
  targetMetrics: MetricDefinition[]
  rollbackTriggers: RollbackCondition[]
}

interface UserAssignment {
  userId: string
  sessionId: string
  experimentGroup: 'control' | 'treatment'
  assignedAt: Date
  sticky: boolean  // Maintain assignment across sessions
}
```

### Metrics Collection Pipeline
```typescript
interface ExperimentMetrics {
  responseTime: {
    p50: number
    p95: number
    p99: number
  }
  completionAccuracy: {
    developerApprovalRate: number
    falsePositiveRate: number
    falseNegativeRate: number
  }
  userExperience: {
    sessionDuration: number
    taskCompletionRate: number
    retryAttempts: number
  }
  systemPerformance: {
    cpuUtilization: number
    memoryUsage: number
    errorRate: number
  }
}
```

### Statistical Analysis Engine
- Bayesian A/B testing for early experiment termination
- Multi-armed bandit algorithms for traffic optimization
- Sample size estimation and power analysis
- Confidence interval calculation for metric differences

## Definition of Done

- [ ] A/B testing framework supports multiple concurrent experiments
- [ ] User assignment is consistent and persistent across sessions
- [ ] Metrics collection captures all required performance and quality data
- [ ] Statistical analysis provides actionable insights on Oracle effectiveness
- [ ] Admin interface allows real-time experiment management
- [ ] Automated alerts trigger for significant performance regressions
- [ ] Privacy compliance measures protect user experiment data
- [ ] Documentation covers experiment setup and analysis procedures

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies
- Enhanced Oracle service (Task 001) for treatment group processing
- Claude Code Bridge API (Task 002) for Oracle integration
- Analytics infrastructure for metrics collection and storage
- Feature flag service for experiment control and rollback

### Data Dependencies
- User behavior analytics for baseline metrics establishment
- Claude Code usage patterns for realistic traffic simulation
- Historical completion verification data for accuracy comparison
- System performance baselines for regression detection

## Estimated Effort

**Duration**: 6-8 weeks
**Complexity**: High
**Risk Level**: Medium

### Breakdown
- **Week 1-2**: Experiment management system and user assignment logic
- **Week 3-4**: Metrics collection pipeline and data validation
- **Week 5-6**: Statistical analysis engine and reporting dashboards
- **Week 7-8**: Safety controls, rollback mechanisms, and testing

## Success Metrics

### Framework Reliability
- **Experiment Accuracy**: 100% correct user assignment and metric attribution
- **Data Quality**: <1% data loss or corruption in metrics collection
- **Safety Response**: Automatic rollback within 30 seconds of trigger conditions

### Analysis Capability
- **Statistical Power**: >80% power for detecting 10% performance differences
- **Reporting Timeliness**: Real-time dashboards with <5 minute metric delays
- **Insight Quality**: Actionable recommendations from statistical analysis

### Operational Excellence
- **Experiment Velocity**: Support for 3+ concurrent A/B tests
- **Admin Efficiency**: Experiment setup and management in <15 minutes
- **Compliance**: 100% privacy regulation compliance for experiment data

## Risks & Mitigation

### High Impact Risks
- **Performance impact on production**: Minimize overhead with efficient metrics collection
- **Statistical bias in results**: Implement proper randomization and sample size controls
- **Data privacy violations**: Comprehensive privacy compliance review and implementation

### Medium Impact Risks
- **Metrics collection overhead**: Optimize collection pipeline and use sampling
- **False positive rollbacks**: Fine-tune trigger thresholds with historical data
- **User experience inconsistency**: Ensure session persistence and smooth transitions

### Low Impact Risks
- **Dashboard performance**: Implement caching and efficient query patterns
- **Experiment configuration complexity**: Provide templates and validation
- **Historical data comparison**: Establish clear baseline measurement periods

## Integration Points

### Claude Code Integration
- Transparent experiment participation without workflow changes
- Consistent user experience regardless of experiment group assignment
- Performance metrics collection at key interaction points

### Oracle Service Integration
- Oracle decision tracking for treatment group analysis
- Performance comparison between Oracle and standard completion paths
- Error handling and fallback behavior measurement

### ccpm.helios Integration
- Stream/Task/Epic level experiment metrics
- Project complexity correlation with Oracle effectiveness
- Long-term impact analysis on development workflows

## Notes

This A/B testing framework is essential for validating Oracle effectiveness and ensuring safe rollout. The framework should be designed for long-term use beyond the initial Oracle implementation, supporting future ccpm.helios feature experimentation. Focus on statistical rigor and operational safety to build confidence in Oracle enhancement decisions.
