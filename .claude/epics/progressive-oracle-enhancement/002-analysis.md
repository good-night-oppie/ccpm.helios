# Task 002 Analysis: Claude Code Bridge API

## Work Stream Breakdown

### Stream A: MCP Protocol Core Implementation
**Agent Type**: backend-architect
**Dependencies**: None
**Files**:
- `src/routes/claudeCodeBridge.js` (enhance existing)
- `src/middleware/mcpProtocol.js` (new)
- `src/services/mcpHandler.js` (new)

**Scope**:
- Implement full MCP v1.0 specification compliance
- Bidirectional communication with Claude Code
- Protocol versioning and capability negotiation
- Standardized error handling and status codes

**Estimated Duration**: 2-3 weeks

### Stream B: Request Routing & Complexity Scoring
**Agent Type**: backend-architect
**Dependencies**: None (can work in parallel with Stream A)
**Files**:
- `src/services/progressiveOracle.js` (enhance existing)
- `src/utils/complexityScoring.js` (enhance existing)
- `src/middleware/routingEngine.js` (new)

**Scope**:
- Request routing: fast-path vs Oracle-path decision making
- Enhanced complexity scoring algorithm for Oracle trigger decisions
- Oracle response caching and deduplication
- Performance optimization for <100ms fast-path responses

**Estimated Duration**: 2-3 weeks

### Stream C: Testing & Performance Validation
**Agent Type**: test-automator
**Dependencies**: Streams A & B (core implementation)
**Files**:
- `src/__tests__/claudeCodeBridge.test.js` (new)
- `src/__tests__/mcpProtocol.test.js` (new)
- `src/__tests__/integration/` (new directory)
- `tests/performance/` (new directory)

**Scope**:
- MCP protocol compliance tests
- Performance benchmark validation (<100ms fast-path)
- Integration testing with Claude Code workflows
- Comprehensive error handling and graceful degradation tests
- Load testing and connection pooling validation

**Estimated Duration**: 1-2 weeks (after Streams A & B)

## Coordination Rules

### Stream Dependencies
- **Streams A & B**: Can run in parallel (different file areas)
- **Stream C**: Starts after A & B reach 70% completion

### File Ownership
- **Stream A**: MCP protocol files (`*mcp*`, bridge routing)
- **Stream B**: Complexity and routing files (`*complexity*`, `*routing*`)
- **Stream C**: All test files (`*test*`, `tests/`)

### Integration Points
- **Week 2**: Stream A exposes MCP interfaces for Stream B integration
- **Week 3**: Streams A & B integrate routing with MCP protocol
- **Week 4**: Stream C begins comprehensive testing of integrated system

## Success Criteria

### Stream A Success
- [ ] MCP protocol implementation passes all compatibility tests
- [ ] Bidirectional communication established
- [ ] Error handling meets specification

### Stream B Success
- [ ] Fast-path routes 100% of simple requests (<100ms)
- [ ] Complexity detection algorithm achieves >85% accuracy
- [ ] Oracle-path integration works seamlessly

### Stream C Success
- [ ] Unit tests cover all routing and caching logic
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet all requirements
- [ ] Integration tests validate Claude Code compatibility

## Risk Mitigation

### High Impact Risks
- **MCP Protocol Complexity**: Stream A focuses on core compliance first
- **Performance Requirements**: Stream B implements caching early
- **Integration Challenges**: Stream C includes real workflow testing

### Coordination Risks
- **File Conflicts**: Clear ownership defined above
- **Interface Changes**: Streams A & B coordinate on shared interfaces
- **Testing Delays**: Stream C can start unit tests before full integration

## Resource Requirements

### Development Infrastructure
- Done Oracle service running for Oracle-path testing
- Mock Claude Code environment for integration testing
- Performance testing environment with load generation

### External Dependencies
- MCP protocol specification and reference implementations
- Claude Code CLI for integration testing
- Network infrastructure for service communication testing
