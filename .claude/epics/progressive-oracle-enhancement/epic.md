# Epic: Progressive Oracle Enhancement

## Overview

Transform Done Oracle from a standalone completion verification service into an intelligent, progressive reasoning system that enhances development workflows. This implementation follows a three-phase approach based on comprehensive Three-Lens Analysis: Foundation infrastructure, Selective Oracle activation, and Learning integration. The system will provide Oracle-driven completion decisions for complex scenarios while maintaining fast-path performance for routine operations.

## Architecture Decisions

### Core Architectural Pattern: Progressive Complexity Bridge
- **Hybrid Architecture**: Fast-path for simple requests, Oracle-path for complex scenarios
- **Feature Flag System**: Instant enable/disable capability for Oracle features
- **MCP Protocol Integration**: Standardized interface for Claude Code bridge
- **Graceful Degradation**: System functions reliably when Oracle unavailable

### Technology Choices
- **Oracle Backend**: Node.js/Express (existing Done Oracle stack)
- **Bridge Layer**: MCP protocol-compliant API with TypeScript
- **Storage**: Existing Done Oracle database with reasoning trace extensions
- **ML Framework**: TensorFlow.js for trigger optimization (Phase 3)
- **Monitoring**: Existing infrastructure with Oracle-specific metrics

### Design Patterns
- **Strategy Pattern**: Different completion detection strategies based on complexity
- **Observer Pattern**: Real-time Oracle decision events for ccpm.helios coordination
- **Circuit Breaker**: Fast failure detection for Oracle service issues
- **A/B Testing**: Controlled rollout with comparison metrics

## Technical Approach

### Frontend Components
- **Claude Code Integration**: Zero UI changes required - Oracle reasoning transparent to users
- **ccpm.helios Dashboard**: Enhanced progress tracking with Oracle verification status
- **Feature Flag Controls**: Admin interface for Oracle activation management
- **Reasoning Trace Viewer**: Optional detailed explanation interface for complex decisions

### Backend Services

#### Claude Code Bridge API
```typescript
interface ClaudeCodeBridge {
  evaluateRequest(request: DevelopmentRequest): Promise<OracleDecision>
  routeRequest(complexity: ComplexityScore): ProcessingPath
  collectMetrics(session: UserSession): AnalyticsData
}
```

#### Oracle Enhancement Engine
- **Complexity Detection**: Multi-factor analysis (file count, cross-system impact, novelty)
- **Reasoning Orchestrator**: Multi-model consensus mechanism for complex decisions
- **Learning System**: Pattern recognition and trigger optimization
- **Verdict Storage**: Immutable Oracle decisions with cryptographic signatures

#### Integration Services
- **ccpm.helios Coordinator**: Stream/Task/Epic level Oracle evaluation endpoints
- **Metrics Collector**: Performance and quality analytics across both paths
- **Event Publisher**: Real-time Oracle decision notifications

### Infrastructure
- **Deployment**: Docker containers with existing Done Oracle infrastructure
- **Scaling**: Horizontal scaling support for Oracle reasoning capacity
- **Monitoring**: Enhanced logging for Oracle decision traces and performance metrics
- **Security**: PKI infrastructure for cryptographic verdict verification

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-3)
**Goal**: Build Oracle infrastructure without changing user experience

**Key Deliverables**:
1. **Oracle Service Enhancement**: Performance optimization and API stability
2. **Claude Code Bridge**: MCP protocol-compliant interface layer
3. **A/B Testing Framework**: Controlled Oracle vs standard comparison
4. **Monitoring Infrastructure**: Comprehensive metrics and alerting

**Risk Mitigation**:
- Parallel systems eliminate migration dependencies
- Feature flags enable instant rollback
- No user experience changes during foundation phase

### Phase 2: Selective Activation (Months 4-6)
**Goal**: Enable Oracle for high-value complex scenarios only

**Key Deliverables**:
1. **Complexity Detection**: Automatic scenario analysis and Oracle triggering
2. **Oracle Reasoning**: Structured decision traces for complex problems
3. **Performance Preservation**: Fast-path maintains <100ms response times
4. **ccpm.helios Integration**: Stream/Task/Epic Oracle coordination

**Risk Mitigation**:
- Gradual rollout to user cohorts
- Performance monitoring with automatic rollback triggers
- Fallback to standard processing for any Oracle failures

### Phase 3: Learning Integration (Months 7-12)
**Goal**: Optimize Oracle based on real usage patterns

**Key Deliverables**:
1. **Adaptive Triggers**: ML-based Oracle activation optimization
2. **Reasoning Patterns**: Library of successful completion decision patterns
3. **Continuous Learning**: Automatic improvement without manual intervention
4. **Full Production**: Complete Oracle deployment with learning capabilities
