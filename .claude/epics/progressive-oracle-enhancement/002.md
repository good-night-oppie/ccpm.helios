# Task 002: Claude Code Bridge API

## Summary

Develop an MCP protocol-compliant bridge API that connects Claude Code with the enhanced Oracle service. This bridge enables seamless Oracle integration while maintaining fast-path performance for routine operations. The implementation provides transparent Oracle reasoning capabilities without requiring changes to existing Claude Code workflows.

## Acceptance Criteria

### MCP Protocol Compliance
- [ ] Full MCP v1.0 specification implementation
- [ ] Bidirectional communication with Claude Code
- [ ] Protocol versioning and capability negotiation
- [ ] Standardized error handling and status codes

### Bridge Functionality
- [ ] Request routing: fast-path vs Oracle-path decision making
- [ ] Complexity scoring algorithm for Oracle trigger decisions
- [ ] Oracle response caching and deduplication
- [ ] Graceful degradation when Oracle service unavailable

### Performance Requirements
- [ ] Fast-path requests: 95th percentile <100ms response time
- [ ] Oracle-path requests: transparent to Claude Code workflow
- [ ] Zero additional latency for simple completion verifications
- [ ] Connection pooling and keep-alive optimization

### Integration Points
- [ ] Claude Code CLI integration with zero configuration changes
- [ ] Authentication and authorization passthrough
- [ ] Request correlation and distributed tracing
- [ ] Real-time Oracle decision event streaming

## Technical Approach

### MCP Bridge Architecture
```typescript
interface ClaudeCodeBridge {
  // Core MCP protocol methods
  initialize(capabilities: MCPCapabilities): Promise<BridgeSession>
  processRequest(request: DevelopmentRequest): Promise<ProcessingResult>
  streamOracleDecision(sessionId: string): AsyncIterator<OracleEvent>

  // Routing logic
  evaluateComplexity(request: DevelopmentRequest): ComplexityScore
  routeRequest(complexity: ComplexityScore): ProcessingPath

  // Performance optimization
  cacheOracleResult(request: string, result: OracleDecision): void
  getFromCache(request: string): OracleDecision | null
}
```

### Complexity Detection Algorithm
```typescript
interface ComplexityFactors {
  fileCount: number           // Number of files affected
  crossSystemImpact: boolean  // Dependencies across multiple systems
  noveltyScore: number        // Similarity to previous completion patterns
  timeConstraints: boolean    // Urgent vs. exploratory development
  userExperience: boolean     // UI/UX changes vs. backend logic
}

function calculateComplexity(request: DevelopmentRequest): ComplexityScore {
  // Multi-factor analysis returning 0.0-1.0 complexity score
  // Threshold >0.7 triggers Oracle-path processing
}
```

### Fast-Path Optimization
- In-memory request deduplication
- Connection pooling with configurable limits
- Async processing for non-blocking Oracle decisions
- Circuit breaker for Oracle service failures

## Definition of Done

- [ ] MCP protocol implementation passes all compatibility tests
- [ ] Bridge routes 100% of simple requests to fast-path (<100ms)
- [ ] Oracle-path integration works seamlessly with Done Oracle
- [ ] Complexity detection algorithm achieves >85% accuracy in testing
- [ ] Claude Code integration requires zero configuration changes
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet all specified requirements
- [ ] Comprehensive API documentation and integration guides
- [ ] Unit tests cover all routing and caching logic

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies
- Enhanced Oracle service (Task 001) for Oracle-path processing
- MCP protocol specification and reference implementations
- Claude Code CLI architecture and integration points
- Authentication infrastructure for service-to-service communication

### External Dependencies
- MCP protocol stability and continued backward compatibility
- Claude Code platform API changes and versioning
- Network infrastructure for service communication
- SSL/TLS certificate management for secure communication

## Estimated Effort

**Duration**: 5-7 weeks
**Complexity**: High
**Risk Level**: Medium-High

### Breakdown
- **Week 1-2**: MCP protocol implementation and testing
- **Week 3-4**: Bridge logic and complexity detection algorithm
- **Week 5-6**: Claude Code integration and performance optimization
- **Week 7**: Testing, documentation, and deployment preparation

## Success Metrics

- **Protocol Compliance**: 100% MCP specification conformance
- **Performance Preservation**: Zero regression in fast-path response times
- **Oracle Integration**: Successful Oracle decision streaming for complex scenarios
- **Reliability**: 99.9% bridge availability with automatic failover to fast-path

## Risks & Mitigation

### High Impact Risks
- **MCP protocol changes**: Implement versioning and backward compatibility
- **Claude Code integration complexity**: Extensive testing with real workflows
- **Oracle service coupling**: Circuit breaker and graceful degradation patterns

### Medium Impact Risks
- **Performance bottlenecks**: Comprehensive load testing and optimization
- **Authentication challenges**: Leverage existing Claude Code auth mechanisms
- **Network reliability**: Implement retry logic and connection pooling

### Low Impact Risks
- **API versioning complexity**: Use semantic versioning and deprecation policies
- **Documentation maintenance**: Automated API documentation generation
- **Testing coverage**: Implement comprehensive integration test suite

## Notes

This bridge API is critical for maintaining seamless Claude Code experience while enabling Oracle capabilities. The implementation must be transparent to users - they should not notice any difference in workflow when Oracle reasoning is active. Focus on performance optimization and reliability to ensure production readiness.
