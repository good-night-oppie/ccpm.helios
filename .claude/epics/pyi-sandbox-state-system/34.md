# Task 34: Monitoring & Observability Dashboard

## Overview

Develop a comprehensive monitoring and observability dashboard for the pyi-sandbox state system that provides real-time visibility into system performance, agent behavior, consensus health, and operational metrics. The dashboard integrates with the distributed architecture and CCPM workflows to provide actionable insights for system administrators, developers, and business stakeholders.

## Problem Statement

Managing a distributed system supporting 850+ concurrent AI agents requires sophisticated monitoring capabilities to:
- Detect performance bottlenecks and system anomalies before they impact operations
- Provide real-time visibility into agent behavior patterns and resource utilization
- Monitor consensus health and distributed system integrity across multiple regions
- Enable proactive capacity planning and resource optimization
- Support troubleshooting and root cause analysis for complex distributed scenarios

Traditional monitoring solutions lack the domain-specific insights needed for AI agent orchestration and quantum-inspired state management systems, requiring a purpose-built observability platform.
