# Stream 3 Todo List: Advanced Features & Testing

## Phase 1: State Entanglement Implementation
- [ ] Design entanglement simulation architecture for dependent agents
- [ ] Implement cross-agent state dependency tracking
- [ ] Create entanglement violation detection and resolution
- [ ] Build entanglement coherence maintenance system
- [ ] Add entanglement metrics and monitoring

## Phase 2: Comprehensive Testing Suite
- [ ] Create unit test framework with >95% coverage target
- [ ] Implement performance benchmarks for all targets (<70μs checkpoint, <10μs restore)
- [ ] Build stress tests for 850+ concurrent agents
- [ ] Create integration tests with Git/BLAKE3 layers
- [ ] Add fault injection and chaos testing

## Phase 3: Real-time Monitoring & Diagnostics
- [ ] Implement performance monitoring with real-time metrics
- [ ] Create state consistency verification system
- [ ] Build anomaly detection and alerting
- [ ] Add debug tooling and introspection capabilities
- [ ] Create health check and system diagnostics

## Phase 4: End-to-End Integration Validation
- [ ] Validate complete system integration across all streams
- [ ] Performance validation against all targets
- [ ] Production readiness assessment
- [ ] Documentation and API finalization

## Success Criteria
- >95% test coverage across all VST components
- All performance targets validated under load
- Zero state corruption in stress testing
- 850+ agent scalability demonstrated
- Production-grade monitoring and alerting
