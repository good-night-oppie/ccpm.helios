### 3. Integrity Verification (`pkg/helios/storage/integrity/`)

**Integrity Checker** (`checker.go`):
- Multi-threaded content verification
- Corruption detection and automatic recovery
- Background integrity scanning
- Recovery from backup, cache, replica, or source
- Comprehensive corruption logging and reporting
