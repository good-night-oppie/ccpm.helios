# Epic: PYI (P-Y-I) Sandbox-Specific State Management System

## Overview

PYI is a quantum-inspired Git-compatible state management system designed to enable AI agents to execute long-horizon compute workloads with sub-100μs checkpoint capabilities. The system implements a Git compatibility layer with transparent backend optimization, supporting 850+ concurrent agents through quantum superposition principles where multiple experimental states coexist until successful computations are observed and preserved.

## Architecture Decisions

### Core Technology Stack
- **Backend Language**: Go 1.23+ for high-performance state management engine
- **Storage Engine**: BLAKE3-based content-addressable storage with RocksDB persistence layer
- **State Management**: Custom VST (Version State Tree) with sub-100μs checkpoint performance
- **Compatibility Layer**: Git protocol compatibility with transparent backend substitution
- **Concurrency Model**: Quantum-inspired parallel state management with intelligent garbage collection

### Key Design Patterns
- **Quantum Superposition Pattern**: Multiple agent states coexist until observation/selection
- **Git Facade Pattern**: Complete Git command compatibility with enhanced backend
- **Copy-on-Write Pattern**: O(1) branching with lazy materialization for memory efficiency
- **Merkle Forest Pattern**: Agent-specific state partitioning for isolation and scaling
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Fallback safety mechanisms for compatibility assurance

### Technology Choices Rationale
- **Go over Rust**: Better ecosystem for Git protocol compatibility and CCPM integration
- **BLAKE3 over SHA-256**: 3-10x faster hashing critical for sub-100μs checkpoint targets
- **RocksDB over Traditional DB**: Optimized for high-frequency checkpoint write patterns
- **Custom VST over Git Objects**: Required for quantum-inspired parallel state management
- **Layered Architecture**: Enables hypothesis-driven development and gradual paradigm transition

## Technical Approach
