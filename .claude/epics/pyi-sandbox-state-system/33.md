# Task 33: Distributed Architecture with Multi-Node Consensus

## Overview

Design and implement a distributed architecture for the pyi-sandbox state system that provides multi-node consensus, fault tolerance, and horizontal scalability. The system leverages advanced consensus algorithms (Raft with Byzantine fault tolerance extensions) to maintain consistent state across geographically distributed nodes while supporting 850+ concurrent AI agents with sub-100μs checkpoint operations.

## Problem Statement

Enterprise AI agent deployment requires distributed infrastructure that can:
- Maintain consistent state across multiple data centers and cloud regions
- Provide automatic failover and disaster recovery capabilities
- Scale horizontally to support growing agent populations and computational demands
- Ensure Byzantine fault tolerance against malicious actors and network partitions
- Support geo-distributed deployments with optimized latency and bandwidth usage

Traditional distributed systems lack the performance characteristics needed for real-time AI agent state management while providing strong consistency guarantees required for mission-critical applications.

## Technical Requirements

### Core Consensus Features
- **Raft-based Consensus**: Leader election, log replication, and safety guarantees
- **Byzantine Fault Tolerance**: Protection against malicious nodes and data corruption
- **Dynamic Membership**: Hot addition/removal of nodes without service interruption
- **Geo-Distribution**: Multi-region deployment with optimized inter-node communication
- **State Sharding**: Intelligent partitioning of agent state across consensus groups

### Performance Targets
- **Consensus Latency**: <10ms for single-region, <50ms for cross-region operations
- **Throughput**: >100,000 state operations/second across distributed cluster
- **Availability**: 99.99% uptime with automatic failover in <30s
- **Consistency**: Linearizable consistency with optional eventual consistency modes
- **Recovery Time**: <5 minutes for complete cluster recovery from total failure

### Advanced Capabilities
- **Adaptive Sharding**: Dynamic repartitioning based on agent access patterns
- **Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs)**: Eventually consistent state for non-critical data
- **Multi-Master Writes**: Regional write optimization with conflict resolution
- **Compression**: State compression and deduplication across consensus log
- **Monitoring**: Real-time consensus health and performance metrics

### State Sharding Strategy
1. **Agent-Based Sharding**: Partition agents across consensus groups by ID ranges
2. **Geo-Proximity**: Co-locate frequently interacting agents in same shard
3. **Load Balancing**: Dynamic shard rebalancing based on computational load
4. **Cross-Shard Operations**: Two-phase commit for operations spanning multiple shards

## Consensus Algorithm Details

### Raft with BFT Extensions
1. **Leader Election**
   - Randomized election timeouts (150-300ms)
   - Priority-based leader selection for geo-optimization
   - Byzantine detection during election process

2. **Log Replication**
   - Batch consensus operations for throughput optimization
   - Pipeline parallel replication to multiple followers
   - Cryptographic signatures on all log entries

3. **Safety Guarantees**
   - Strong consistency through linearizable operations
   - Byzantine fault tolerance up to f=(n-1)/3 malicious nodes
   - Automatic conflict resolution for concurrent operations

### Performance Optimizations
1. **Adaptive Batching**: Dynamic batch sizes based on load and latency requirements
2. **Parallel Processing**: Concurrent consensus for independent operations
3. **Locality Optimization**: Prefer local operations when strong consistency not required
4. **Snapshot Optimization**: Incremental snapshots with deduplication
