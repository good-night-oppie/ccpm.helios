# Task 32: CCPM Integration with Multi-Writer Documentation Workflow

## Overview

Integrate the pyi-sandbox state system with CCPM (Collaborative Code Project Management) to enable seamless multi-writer documentation workflows. This integration allows multiple technical writers, developers, and stakeholders to collaborate on documentation in real-time while maintaining version control, conflict resolution, and audit trails through the VST engine's quantum state management capabilities.

## Problem Statement

Modern software development requires collaborative documentation workflows that support:
- Multiple concurrent writers with real-time conflict resolution
- Granular version control with branching and merging capabilities
- Integration with existing development workflows and toolchains
- Audit trails and approval processes for documentation changes
- Cross-reference consistency checking across large documentation sets

Traditional documentation tools lack the sophisticated state management needed for enterprise-scale collaborative editing while maintaining performance and consistency guarantees.

## Technical Requirements

### Core Functionality
- **Multi-Writer Coordination**: Real-time collaborative editing with operational transform-based conflict resolution
- **Version Control Integration**: Git-compatible versioning with branch/merge support for documentation
- **Change Tracking**: Granular audit trails with user attribution and approval workflows
- **Cross-Reference Validation**: Automatic link checking and consistency validation across documentation
- **Live Preview**: Real-time rendering with collaborative cursor tracking and inline comments

### CCPM Integration Points
- **Project Synchronization**: Bidirectional sync between CCPM projects and documentation state
- **Task-Documentation Linking**: Automatic association of documentation changes with project tasks
- **Review Workflows**: Integration with CCPM approval processes and milestone tracking
- **Notification System**: Real-time updates for documentation changes affecting project deliverables
- **Metrics Dashboard**: Documentation velocity, coverage, and quality metrics in CCPM interface

### Performance Targets
- **Collaborative Latency**: <50ms for real-time editing operations
- **Conflict Resolution**: <100ms for operational transform conflict resolution
- **Sync Performance**: <500ms for CCPM project synchronization
- **Cross-Reference Validation**: <2s for full documentation consistency check
- **Version History**: <1s for accessing any historical version

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Integration (Day 1)
1. **CCPM API Integration**
   - Implement CCPM authentication and project discovery
   - Create bidirectional sync service for project metadata
   - Establish real-time notification channels

2. **Documentation State Model**
   - Extend VST engine to support document tree structures
   - Implement operational transform algorithms for collaborative editing
   - Create document versioning with branch/merge capabilities

### Phase 2: Advanced Features (Day 2)
1. **Multi-Writer Workflows**
   - Real-time collaborative editor with cursor tracking
   - Conflict resolution UI with merge tool integration
   - Comment and review system with approval workflows

2. **Quality Assurance**
   - Cross-reference validation engine
   - Documentation coverage metrics
   - Automated link checking and consistency validation

### Data Flow
1. **Write Operations**: Editor → Operational Transform → VST Engine → CCPM Sync
2. **Read Operations**: CCPM Query → VST State → Rendered Document → Editor
3. **Conflict Resolution**: Multiple Writers → OT Algorithm → Consensus State → All Editors
4. **Validation**: Cross-Reference Engine → VST Query → Consistency Report → CCPM Metrics

## Acceptance Criteria

### Alerting Thresholds
- Collaborative editing latency >100ms
- Conflict resolution failures >1%
- CCPM sync failures >0.5%
- Cross-reference validation errors >5%
- Documentation rendering failures >0.1%

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- CCPM API access and authentication
- Operational transform library (ShareJS or similar)
- Real-time communication framework (WebSocket/SSE)
