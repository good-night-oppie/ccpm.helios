# Task 27: BLAKE3 Content-Addressable Storage Foundation

## Overview

Implement the foundational BLAKE3-based content-addressable storage system that serves as the backbone for PYI's quantum-inspired state management. This storage layer provides 3-10x faster hashing performance compared to SHA-256, enabling the sub-100μs checkpoint performance targets while maintaining cryptographic integrity and deduplication efficiency.

## Problem Statement

Traditional Git storage has fundamental limitations for AI agent workloads:
- SHA-256 hashing is too slow for sub-100μs checkpoint operations
- Poor deduplication efficiency for sandbox-specific content patterns
- Inadequate performance for 850+ concurrent write operations
- Limited support for quantum-inspired parallel state management

The BLAKE3 storage foundation must provide high-performance content addressing with 90%+ deduplication efficiency while supporting the VST engine's checkpoint requirements.

## Technical Requirements

### Core Functionality
- **BLAKE3 Hashing**: Content addressing with cryptographic integrity verification
- **Deduplication Engine**: Automatic content deduplication with 90%+ efficiency
- **RocksDB Integration**: High-performance persistent storage with checkpoint optimization
- **Concurrent Access**: Thread-safe operations for 850+ concurrent agents
- **Integrity Verification**: Automatic corruption detection and recovery mechanisms

### Performance Targets
- **Hash Computation**: <10μs for typical content blocks (1KB-1MB)
- **Storage Write**: <50μs for content storage including deduplication check
- **Content Retrieval**: <5μs for cache hits, <100μs for disk retrieval
- **Deduplication**: 90%+ storage efficiency for sandbox-specific workloads
- **Concurrent Throughput**: 10,000+ operations/second with 850+ concurrent agents

### Storage Design Requirements
- **Content Addressing**: BLAKE3 hash-based content identification
- **Block-Level Deduplication**: Efficient storage of duplicate content across agents
- **Compression**: Optional content compression for large objects
- **Versioning**: Support for content history and garbage collection
- **Backup/Recovery**: Automated backup and point-in-time recovery capabilities

## Architecture Design

### Component Structure
```go
package storage

type ContentStore interface {
    Store(content []byte) (Hash, error)
    Retrieve(hash Hash) ([]byte, error)
    Exists(hash Hash) bool
    Delete(hash Hash) error
    GarbageCollect(refs []Hash) error
}

type DeduplicationEngine interface {
    CheckDuplicate(content []byte) (Hash, bool, error)
    UpdateReferenceCount(hash Hash, delta int) error
    GetReferenceCount(hash Hash) (int, error)
    ListUnreferenced(cutoff time.Time) ([]Hash, error)
}

type IntegrityChecker interface {
    VerifyContent(hash Hash, content []byte) error
    ScanForCorruption() ([]Hash, error)
    RepairContent(hash Hash) error
    ValidateStorageIntegrity() error
}
```
